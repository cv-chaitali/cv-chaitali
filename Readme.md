# Hi there, I'm Chaitali! (Pronounced as Choitali)👋

🎓 `CS-PhD Student` | 🌏 `DGIST` | 💡 `AI Researcher` | 🚀 `LLMs Enthusiast`

---

🌟 My research is focused on `Efficient AI` and `Large Language Models (LLMs)` at the `CELL Lab, DGIST`.  
My journey in AI began with `vision models` during my MS, where I explored the realms of `generative models`, `data generalization`, and `classification`.
